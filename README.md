# binary-tree
Project title: Binary Tree
This project is a assignment on trees from CISC 3130 Data Structure Class at Brooklyn College.

This project will process several sets of numbers.
For each set of numbers, I will 
1. create a bianry tree
2. print the trees using inorder, preorder, postorder.
3. call a subroutine "count" that will returns the number of nodes in the trees.
4. call a subroutine "children" that prints the number of children each node has
5. Insert and delete several nodes according to  the instructions given
6. Print the tree again usign inorder, preorder, and postorder
7. call subroutine count again, returning the number of nodes in the trees.
8. call a subroutine children again, printing the number of children each node has
9. free the tree.
